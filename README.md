# 🐹 Whack-a-Mole

**Whack-a-Mole** is a simple and fun mini-game built with **Vite** and **Vanilla JavaScript**.  
The goal is to click (or whack!) the mole 🐹 as it appears in one of the holes before it disappears.  
Built with a clean, retro-inspired UI and a soft gray theme for a minimal arcade feel.
